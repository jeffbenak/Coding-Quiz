This project is a coding quiz with five questions, and each question has four answer choices. There is a timer at the top left, and you get 75 seconds to complete the quiz.
If you get a question wrong, ten seconds will be deducted off the timer count. 
Once you finish each question, your score will be displayed, and you will be asked to enter your initials. Once you hit submit with your initials entered, your initials with your score next to them will be added to the highscore list.
